# Anything I don't describe is treated literally.
#
# %?        - Start of a conditional statement.
#  %F       - Use this part of the statement if the window has focus (i.e. it
#             is the only window or the currently active one).
#  %{-b bc} - Turn off bold, blue foreground, cyan background.
# %:        - else
#  %{-b bb} - Turn off bold, blue foreground, blue background (this obscures
#             the text on non-focused windows and just gives a blue line).
# %?        - End conditional statement.
#  %C       - time (hh:mm, leading space) in 12 hour format
#  %D       - Three-letter day-of-week appreviation
#  %M       - Three-letter month appreviation
#  %d       - Day of the month
#  %H       - hostname
#  %?       - Start of conditional statement.
# %F      - Use this part of the statement if the window has focus.
# %{+u wb}  - underlined, white foreground, blue background
#  %?       - End conditional (if not focused, text remaind blue on blue).
#  %L=    - truncation/padding point.  With the 'L' qualifier, basically
#             just acts as a reference point.  Further truncation/padding is
#             done relative to here, not the beginning of the string
#  %-Lw   - window list up to but not including the current window (-),
#             show window flags (L)
#  %45>   - truncation/padding marker; place this point about 45% of the
#             way into the display area (45)
#  %{+b by} - add bold (still underlined from before), blue foreground,
#             yellow background
#    %n   - number of the current window
#    %f   - flags for current window
#    %t   - title of current window
#  %{-}   - undo last color change (so now we're back to underlined white
#             on blue)  (technically, this is a pop; a second invocation
#             would drop things back to unadorned blue on cyan)
#  %+Lw   - window list from the next window on (-), show window flags (L)
#  %-0<   - truncation/padding point.  Place this point zero spaces (0)
#             from the right margin (-).
